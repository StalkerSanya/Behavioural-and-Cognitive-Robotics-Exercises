## Exercise 1
- location of python code: /exercize_1

   I runned 2 environment "CartPole-vO" and "Pendulum-v0" and studied parameters of env.observation and env.action. For example, for env.action of "CartPole-vO" we have two discrete actions and for env.action of "Pendulum-v0" we have one continuous action.

## Exercise 2
- location of python code: /exercize_2

  For "CartPole-vO" my script slove problem, such as give me 5 best neuron nets with max reward(I cheked), but in case  "Pendulum-v0" script doesn't solve problem, I think in this case we need more episodes, generations and max steps for 1 episode or possibly also need to increase number of hidden layers of neurons, because 5 is too small.

## Exercise 3 
   -For "Acrobot-v1" I train neuron net for different seeds. For different seeds we obtain similar results which give us the best fitness near -60. Also training neuron net doesn't solve problem, maybe we need more ntrains.
